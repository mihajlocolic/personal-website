              Hi there! My name is Mihajlo, i'm twenty one years old self taught software developer from Serbia.
              I'm focused more on back-end part and how things function rather than design. I have been learning to program for more than two years now.
              Began with game server scripting, which motivated me and scratched my curiosity for logic behind applications.
              I have finished a one year education program for learning Java and some basic concepts of programming, and i'm reaching the end of Harvards CS50x course for Computer Science.
              Open for work opportunities, learning new things and gaining more experience.
            </p>

          <p>
            My name is Mihajlo Čolić, i'm twenty one years old and i'm from Serbia. I graduated in economic and trade high school in Smederevo as culinary chef.
            After school i started to pursue programming career as self taught, inspired by previous history of game server scripting in a simple extension language that has some C-like syntax.
            Also graduated in one year education program from ITAcademy as certified Java developer, gaining familiarity with Java language, and basics of programming.
            After that i wanted to get better understanding of Computer Science and build a more solid foundation that i couldn't get from prior education, so i took Harvards CS50x course.
            There i learned alot and did many problem sets and labs, which were very challenging and required dedication and many hours of work.
            Besides programming, other things that interest me are Eastern Orthodox spirituality and theology. As cradle Orthodox layman i love reading and learning Orthodox theology in my free time.
